Currently, I only have the following wallpapers below. They have been tested on iPhone because I don't have a ton of time. If you have any requests or problems, please submit them via [email](mailto:ben@habituwall.com), and [subscribe](/subscribe/) for updates.

DISCLAIMER: Use at your own risk. You should consult your doctor (and maybe your mom) for any lifestyle or exercise changes.

To save these as your wallpaper:
* Long-press on an image and save it to your photos
* Then follow [these instructions](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/change-the-wallpaper-iph3d267104/ios) 

I personally only set the wallpaper for the lockscreen because it's too full of ransackery when added to the home screen.
